# Reservoir

The printing of reservoir output is controlled by entering "y" or "n" in the _reservoir_ line in [print.prt](../introduction-1/simulation-settings/print.prt/). In addition, a basin average of all reservoirs can be printed by entering "y" in the _basin\_res_ line in [print.prt](../introduction-1/simulation-settings/print.prt/). Reservoir output can be printed at daily, monthly, yearly, and average annual time steps. The names of the reservoir output files are as follows:&#x20;

* reservoir\_day.txt
* reservoir\_mon.txt
* reservoir\_yr.txt
* reservoir\_aa.txt
* basin\_res\_day.txt
* basin\_res\_mon.txt
* basin\_res\_yr.txt
* basin\_res\_aa.txt

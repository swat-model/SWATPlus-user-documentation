# Hydrographs

SWAT+ prints two hydrograph output files per time step, one for incoming and one for outgoing hydrographs. The printing of hydrographs is controlled by entering "y" or "n" in the _hyd_ line in [print.prt](../introduction-1/simulation-settings/print.prt/). Hydrographs can be printed at daily, monthly, yearly, and average annual time steps. The names of the hydrograph output files are as follows:&#x20;

* hydin\_day.txt
* hydout\_day.txt
* hydin\_mon.txt
* hydout\_mon.txt
* hydin\_yr.txt
* hydout\_yr.txt
* hydin\_aa.txt
* hydout\_aa.txt

The number of lines in the hydrograph output files depends on the number of connections between spatial objects defined in the SWAT+ setup. In the incoming hydrograph files, for each receiving object there will be one line  per source object it receives a hydrograph from. The number of lines per source object in the outgoing hydrograph files equals the number of receiving objects it sends hydrographs to.&#x20;

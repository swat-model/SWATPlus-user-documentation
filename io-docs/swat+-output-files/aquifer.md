# Aquifer

The printing of aquifer output is controlled by entering "y" or "n" in the _aquifer_ line in [print.prt](../introduction-1/simulation-settings/print.prt/). In addition, a basin average of all aquifers can be printed by entering "y" in the _basin\_aqu_ line in [print.prt](../introduction-1/simulation-settings/print.prt/). Aquifer output can be printed at daily, monthly, yearly, and average annual time steps. The names of the aquifer output files are as follows:&#x20;

* aquifer\_day.txt
* aquifer\_mon.txt
* aquifer\_yr.txt
* aquifer\_aa.txt
* basin\_aqu\_day.txt
* basin\_aqu\_mon.txt
* basin\_aqu\_yr.txt
* basin\_aqu\_aa.txt

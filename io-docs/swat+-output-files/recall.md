# Recall

The printing of recall object output is controlled by entering "y" or "n" in the _recall_ line in [print.prt](../introduction-1/simulation-settings/print.prt/). In addition, a basin average of all recall objects can be printed by entering "y" in the _basin\_psc_ line in [print.prt](../introduction-1/simulation-settings/print.prt/). Recall object output can be printed at daily, monthly, yearly, and average annual time steps. The names of the recall object output files are as follows:&#x20;

* recall\_day.txt
* recall\_mon.txt
* recall\_yr.txt
* recall\_aa.txt
* basin\_psc\_day.txt
* basin\_psc\_mon.txt
* basin\_psc\_yr.txt
* basin\_psc\_aa.txt

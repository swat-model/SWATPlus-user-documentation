Signed groundwater exchange with wetlands.

**Unit:** mm.

The daily exchange is normalized over total basin area. Monthly and yearly values accumulate the daily exchanges; average-annual output gives the mean annual value over the reporting years. Keep the reported sign when combining gains and losses.

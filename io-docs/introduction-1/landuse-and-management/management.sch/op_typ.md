| pcom | Plant community                      | This operation initializes the plant community in the HRU                                                                                                                    |
| plnt | Planting/beginning of growing season | This operation initializes the growth of a specific land cover/plant type in the HRU                                                                                         |
| harv | Harvest                              | This operation harvests the portion of the plant designated as yield and removes the yield from the HRU, but allows the plant to continue to grow (e.g. hay cuttings)        |
| hvkl | Harvest and kill                     | This operation harvests the portion of the plant designated as yield, removes the yield from the HRU and converts the remaining plant biomass to residue on the soil surface |
| kill | Kill                                 | This operation kills the plant and converts the plant biomass to residue on the soil surface                                                                                 |
| till | Tillage                              | This operation mixes the upper soil layers and redistributes the nutrients/chemicals within those layers                                                                     |

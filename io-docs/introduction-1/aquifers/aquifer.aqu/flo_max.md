# bf\_max

This parameter determines the daily groundwater flow amount needed for all channels linked to an aquifer to receive groundwater flow. If groundwater flow < _flo\_max_, the channels with the smallest drainage areas will stop receiving groundwater flow. The amount of groundwater flow a channel receives depends on the channel length.

{% hint style="info" %}
This parameter is only active when the file [**aqu\_cha.lin**](../../connectivity/aqu_cha.lin.md) is used instead of [**aquifer.con**](../../connectivity/hru.con/) to connect aquifers to channels.&#x20;

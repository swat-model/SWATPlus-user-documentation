# alg\_shd\_nl

The light extinction coefficient, $$k_l$$, is calculated as a function of the algal density using the nonlinear equation:

$$k_l=k_{l,0}+k_{l,1}*\alpha_0*algae+k_{l,2}*(\alpha_0*algae)^{2/3}$$               &#x20;

where $$k_{l,0}$$ is the non-algal portion of the light extinction coefficient ($$m^{-1}$$), $$k_{l,1}$$ is the linear algal self shading coefficient ($$m^{-1}(\mu g - chla/L)^{-1})$$, $$k_{l,2}$$ is the nonlinear algal self shading coefficient $$m^{-1}(\mu g - chla/L)^{-2/3})$$, $$\alpha_0$$is the ratio of chlorophyll _a_ to algal biomass ($$\mu g$$ chla/mg alg), and $$algae$$ is the algal biomass concentration (mg alg/L).

This equation allows a variety of algal, self-shading, light extinction relationships to be modeled. When both $$k_{l,1}$$ and $$k_{l,2}$$ are set to 0, no algal self-shading is simulated. When $$k_{l,1}$$ is set to a value other than 0 and $$k_{l,2}$$ is set to 0, linear algal self-shading is modeled. When both $$k_{l,1}$$ and $$k_{l,2}$$ are set to a value other than 0, non-linear algal self-shading is modeled.&#x20;

The Riley equation (Bowie et al., 1985) defines $$k_{l,1} = 0.0088 m^{-1}(\mu g - chla/L)^{-1}$$ and $$k_{l,2} = 0.054 m^{-1}(\mu g - chla/L)^{-2/3})$$.

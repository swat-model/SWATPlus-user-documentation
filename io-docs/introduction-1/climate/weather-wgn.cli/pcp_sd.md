description: Standard deviation for daily precipitation in month
---

# pcp\_sd

This parameter quantifies the variability in precipitation for each month. The standard deviation is calculated as

$$
σ_{mon}=\sqrt{(\frac{∑_{d=1}^N*(R_{day,mon}-R_{mon} )^2 }{N-1}})
$$

where $$σ_{mon}$$ is the standard deviation for daily precipitation in month $$mon$$ (mm H2O), $$R_{day,mon}$$ is the amount of precipitation for day $$d$$ in month $$mon$$ (mm H2O), $$R_{mon}$$ is the average precipitation for the month (mm H2O), and $$N$$ is the total number of daily precipitation records for month $$mon$$. Daily precipitation values of 0 mm are included in the standard deviation calculation.

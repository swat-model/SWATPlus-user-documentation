# soils.sol

The structure of the file **soils.sol** is different than that of most other SWAT+ input files. Depending on the number of soil layers, the file contains two to ten lines per soil. The first line for each soil specifies the variables that apply to the entire soil profile (see first table below). The remaining soil variables are layer-specific and are specified in one line per layer starting one line below the general soil variables (see second table below). The figure below illustrates the structure of a **soils.sol** file with three soils. Please note that due to space restrictions not all layer-specific variables are included.

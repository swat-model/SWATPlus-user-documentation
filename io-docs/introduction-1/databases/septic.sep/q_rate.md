**Code reference:** `sepdb(is)%qs` ([declaration](https://github.com/swat-model/swatplus/blob/6f515368525e7d84089ae0f9d33f4c9115de5679/src/septic_data_module.f90#L7)).

McCray et al. (2005) proposed 0.227 m3/capita/day as the median value for the United States based on the data collected from various sources.

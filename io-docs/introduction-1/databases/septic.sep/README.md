# septic.sep

Information of water quality or effluent characteristics required to simulate different types of Onsite Wastewater Systems (OWSs) is stored in the septic water quality database. The information contained in the septic water quality database includes the septic tank effluent flow rate for per capita and the effluent characteristics of various septic systems. The database file distributed with SWAT+ includes water quality data for most conventional, advanced, and failing septic systems. It was developed based on the field data summarized by Siegrist et al. (2005), McCray et al. (2005), and OWTS 201 (2005).

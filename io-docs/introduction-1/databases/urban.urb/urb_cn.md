# urb\_cn

**Code reference:** `urbdb(iu)%urbcn2` ([declaration](https://github.com/swat-model/swatplus/blob/6f515368525e7d84089ae0f9d33f4c9115de5679/src/urban_data_module.f90#L16)).

SWAT+ reads this value from `urban.urb` but does not use it afterward, so changing it has no effect. For daily curve-number runoff, the model instead uses a fixed curve number of 98 for impervious urban area.

# print.prt

The **print.prt** file is formatted differently than most other SWAT+ input files (see figure below). In line three, there are several variables for controlling the time period to be printed. In line five, the user can specify the number of print intervals for average annual output. In line seven, the user can select to have output files printed in a specific file format (in addition to the default \*.txt output files). In line 9, the user can control the printing of outputs for soils and management as well as flow duration curves. In lines 11 to 90, there is a list of outputs for different spatial levels and objects that can be printed at daily, monthly, yearly, and average annual time steps. A description of the output files is provided in the [SWAT+ Output Files](https://app.gitbook.com/s/-MTFpIHUB1K63DLhLJaf/swat+-output-files) section.  &#x20;

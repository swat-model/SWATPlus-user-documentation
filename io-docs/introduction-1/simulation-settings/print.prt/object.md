description: Objects that output can be printed for at different time steps
---

# object

The table below lists the objects that are listed in the first column of this section of the **print.prt** file. For each of these objects, output can be printed at daily, monthly, yearly, and average annual time steps by entering y (=yes) or n (=no) in the following four columns.

{% hint style="info" %}
The user is advised to print only those outputs that are needed for model evaluation or further analysis. Especially daily printing can result in very large output files that may exceed hard drive storage.
{% endhint %}

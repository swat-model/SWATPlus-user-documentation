description: Objects that output can be printed for at different time steps

# object

**Code reference:** `name` ([declaration](https://github.com/swat-model/swatplus/blob/6f515368525e7d84089ae0f9d33f4c9115de5679/src/basin_print_codes_read.f90#L11)).

The table below lists the objects that are listed in the first column of this section of the **print.prt** file. For each of these objects, output can be printed at daily, monthly, yearly, and average annual time steps by entering y (=yes) or n (=no) in the following four columns.

{% hint style="info" %}
The user is advised to print only those outputs that are needed for model evaluation or further analysis. Especially daily printing can result in very large output files that may exceed hard drive storage.

GWFlow output rows require label-based object parsing: set use_obj_lbls to a value other than n. When gwflow_wb is listed, its daily, monthly, yearly, and average annual switches replace the corresponding gwflow.input water-balance settings. The daily water-balance switch also controls channel hydrograph-separation output.

gwflow_obs and gwflow_solute select their four output periods independently. gwflow_heat supports daily, yearly, and average annual output; its monthly column does not enable a monthly heat-balance output. If the heat or solute row is omitted, its periods follow the water-balance settings. If the observation row is omitted, its four period flags retain their default enabled values.

gwflow_pump is a group switch: any y among its four columns enables pumping output at all implemented periods; four n values disable the group. gwflow_flux is also a group switch: a y in its daily or yearly column enables its diagnostics; its monthly and average annual columns do not enable the group. These two rows do not independently select output periods.

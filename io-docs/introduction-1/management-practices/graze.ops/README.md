# graze.ops

This operation removes plant biomass at a specified rate and allows simultaneous application of manure.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
The parameter values of the pre-defined grazing operations are very rough estimates. If grazing is relevant in a watershed, the user should research their own values based on the stocking rate and type of animal.
